# Mount GH host configuration into the web container so that `gh`
# inside the container shares the same global.
# The pre-start hook in config.gh.yaml ensures all host paths exist
# as the correct type (file vs. directory) before Docker attempts to bind-mount them.
# Without that hook, Docker would create a directory at any missing file path,
# silently breaking the mount instead of raising an error.
